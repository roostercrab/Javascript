Eventually you come to accept that as an app developer, your primary job is to render lists. It's so fundamental, that most frameworks come with a special API to accomplish it.

Vue
<ul id="tweets">
  <li v-for="tweet in tweets">{{ tweet.text }}</li>
</ul>

Angular
<ul id="tweets">
  <li *ngFor="let tweet of tweets">{{ tweet.text }}</li>
</ul>

React
React takes a different approach. When possible, React tries to keep the API surface to a minimum. To do that, it relies heavily on features that JavaScript provides out of the box. When rendering a list, the end goal, as seen in the Vue and Angular examples above, is to create a list of <li> elements that we can then show to the UI. Can you think of anything built into JavaScript itself that would help us accomplish this? What about .map? Typically you use .map when you need to create a new array, based on a previous array. Something like this.

const tweets = [
  {
    id: 1,
    stars: 13,
    text: 'Turns out "git reset --hard HEAD^" was a terrible idea.',
  },
  { id: 2, stars: 87, text: "Tech conferences are too expensive." },
  {
    id: 3,
    stars: 51,
    text: "Clean code is subjective. Optimize for deletion.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    stars: 19,
    text:
      "Maybe the real benefit of open source was the friendships we made along the way?",
  },
];

const stars = tweets.map((tweet) => tweet.stars); // [13,87,51,19]

Except now instead of creating a new array of stars, we want to create a new array of <li>s. Using the same .map method, let's throw in some JSX.

<ul id="tweets">
  {tweets.map((tweet) => (
    <li>{tweet.text}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

ðŸ‘Œ Solid. There's no new API you need to remember. If you can remember how .map works, you can remember how to create a list in React.

Caveat ðŸ’©
Unfortunately, we're not quite done yet. There's just one small addition we need to make to our code. Whenever you use .map to create a list in React, you need to make sure that you add a unique key prop to each list item.

<ul id="tweets">
  {tweets.map((tweet) => (
    <li key={tweet.id}>{tweet.text}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

It's React's job to make rendering the list as fast as possible. When you give each list item a unique key prop, it helps React know which items, if any, change throughout different renders of that component.
